{"name":"CTask-lite","google":"","body":"![CTask Screenshot](http://img223.imageshack.us/img223/9069/ctasklitev1screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nCTask-Lite is perfect for users not worried about the sensitivity of their task information and do not want the extra \"bloat\" that might be associated with other task management tools. For example, I use this software to allow game modification teams that I work with to task me with programming assignments or list bugs that need attention. Any user can go to the website and add, remove, or modify a task. There are few features, which keep it simple. It is a task management system in the most basic form. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* PHP5+\r\n* IIS/Apache Web Server\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Single-page interface using Ajax and jQuery\r\n* SQLite database -- great if you don't have access to a MySQL database or you've used your quota of database instances. Plus it makes backups very easy.\r\n* Themeable with jQuery Theme Roller themes & some minor custom CSS\r\n\r\n## Guides\r\n* View the [Installation and Configuration Guide](https://github.com/cdunlap/ctask-lite/wiki/Install-and-Configuration-Guide)\r\n* View the [Themeroller Themeing Guide](https://github.com/cdunlap/ctask-lite/wiki/Theming-Guide)","note":"Don't delete this file!
