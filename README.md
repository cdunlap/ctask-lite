ctask-lite
==========

A simple, fast, and easy to use/customize task management system written in PHP, jQuery, and SQLite. Based on CTask, but slimmed down. No users, no attachments, no bloat. This means you can wrap whatever BLOB storage system and/or authentication mechanism around it to make it as simple or as complex as you wish.
